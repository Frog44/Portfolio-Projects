# Portfolio-Projects
I am Robbie, a ambitious mechanical engineer with a dangerous intrest in using programming, data science, and AI to automate tasks.

This Repository will hold all of the code and queries for my portfolio projects, both done and in progress.

Most projects will be done in excel, SQL, or Python with help from Tableau or Power BI for presentations. Some code will be basic .py files and others use google collab depending on the task.

Please feel free to reference them if you find them useful.

I hope this is helpful and enjoy!
